# Music Generation

Music generated using LSTM and GAN.

- LSTM folder has all the files required for the LSTM model generation, lstm.py trains the model while predict.py predicts or generates the output.
- GAN folder has all the files for generation of music using GAN.
- Data folder has all the data sets for the project.
- Final\_Output folder has the output midi files and mp3 files along with the .ipynb to generate the output graphs for the midi files.
- The Reports and Presentation folder has a presentation video and report for the project.
- Scrapping has the scraping files to download the dataset.
- Download the LSTM model weights from this link ([https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C8M95GKPkFWG3mFJuYu-cOXkZc0uTqe9](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C8M95GKPkFWG3mFJuYu-cOXkZc0uTqe9)) and add it to LSTM/weights.
